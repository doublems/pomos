# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

> In the software industry a changelog, as the name suggests, is a file that logs all the changes made to a specific software program. The reason for creating and keeping a changelog is simple; when a contributor or end-user wants to see if any changes have been made to a software program, they can do that easily and precisely by reading the changelog. All they need to do is go to the changelog and it will show what, and when, any changes were made between the different versions or releases of the particular software. - https://changelog.md
